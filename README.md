# Ubiq Security Java Library

The Ubiq Security Java library provides convenient interaction with the Ubiq Security Platform API from applications written in the Java language.  It includes a pre-defined set of classes that will provide simple interfaces to encrypt and decrypt data.

This library also incorporates Ubiq Format Preserving Encryption (eFPE).  eFPE allows encrypting so that the output cipher text is in the same format as the original plaintext. This includes preserving special characters and control over what characters are permitted in the cipher text. For example, consider encrypting a social security number '123-45-6789'. The cipher text will maintain the dashes and look something like: 'W$+-qF-oMMV'.

## Usage

The library needs to be configured with your account credentials which is
available in your [Ubiq Dashboard][dashboard] [credentials][credentials].
The credentials can be set using environment variables, loaded from an explicitly
specified file, or read from the default location (~/.ubiq/credentials).



### Referencing the Ubiq Security library
Make sure your source files import these public types from the ```ubiqsecurity``` library:

```java
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqDecrypt;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqEncrypt;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqFactory;
```

### Read credentials from a specific file and use a specific profile
```java
UbiqCredentials credentials = UbiqFactory.readCredentialsFromFile("some-credential-file", "some-profile");
```

### Read credentials from ~/.ubiq/credentials and use the default profile
```java
UbiqCredentials credentials = UbiqFactory.readCredentialsFromFile("", "default");
```

### Use the following environment variables to set the credential values
UBIQ_ACCESS_KEY_ID
UBIQ_SECRET_SIGNING_KEY
UBIQ_SECRET_CRYPTO_ACCESS_KEY
```java
UbiqCredentials credentials = UbiqFactory.createCredentials(null, null, null, null);
```

### Explicitly set the credentials
```java
UbiqCredentials credentials = UbiqFactory.createCredentials("<yourAccessKey>", "<yourSigningKey>", "<yourCryptoKey>", null);
```

### Runtime exceptions

Unsuccessful requests raise exceptions. The exception object will contain the error details.

### Encrypt a simple block of data

Pass credentials and plaintext bytes into the encryption function.  The encrypted data
bytes will be returned.

```java
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqEncrypt;

UbiqCredentials credentials = ...;
byte[] plainBytes = ...;
byte[] encryptedBytes = UbiqEncrypt.encrypt(credentials, plainBytes);
```

### Decrypt a simple block of data

Pass credentials and encrypted data into the decryption function.  The plaintext data
bytes will be returned.

```java
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqDecrypt;

UbiqCredentials credentials = ...;
byte[] encryptedBytes = ...;
byte[] plainBytes = UbiqDecrypt.decrypt(credentials, encryptedBytes);
```

### Encrypt a large data element where data is loaded in chunks

- Create an encryption object using the credentials.
- Call the encryption instance ```begin()``` method.
- Call the encryption instance ```update()``` method repeatedly until all the data is processed.
- Call the encryption instance ```end()``` method.

 Here's the example code from the reference source:

 ```java
static void piecewiseEncryption(String inFile, String outFile, UbiqCredentials ubiqCredentials)
        throws IOException, IllegalStateException, InvalidCipherTextException {
    try (FileInputStream plainStream = new FileInputStream(inFile)) {
        try (FileOutputStream cipherStream = new FileOutputStream(outFile)) {
            try (UbiqEncrypt ubiqEncrypt = new UbiqEncrypt(ubiqCredentials, 1)) {
                // start the encryption
                byte[] cipherBytes = ubiqEncrypt.begin();
                cipherStream.write(cipherBytes);

                // process 128KB at a time
                var plainBytes = new byte[0x20000];

                // loop until the end of the input file is reached
                int bytesRead = 0;
                while ((bytesRead = plainStream.read(plainBytes, 0, plainBytes.length)) > 0) {
                    cipherBytes = ubiqEncrypt.update(plainBytes, 0, bytesRead);
                    cipherStream.write(cipherBytes);
                }

                // finish the encryption
                cipherBytes = ubiqEncrypt.end();
                cipherStream.write(cipherBytes);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Decrypt a large data element where data is loaded in chunks

- Create a decryption object using the credentials.
- Call the decryption instance ```begin()``` method.
- Call the decryption instance ```update()``` method repeatedly until all data is processed.
- Call the decryption instance ```end()``` method

Here's the example code from the reference source:

 ```java
static void piecewiseDecryption(String inFile, String outFile, UbiqCredentials ubiqCredentials)
        throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, IllegalStateException, InvalidCipherTextException {
    try (FileInputStream cipherStream = new FileInputStream(inFile)) {
        try (FileOutputStream plainStream = new FileOutputStream(outFile)) {
            try (UbiqDecrypt ubiqDecrypt = new UbiqDecrypt(ubiqCredentials)) {
                // start the decryption
                byte[] plainBytes = ubiqDecrypt.begin();
                plainStream.write(plainBytes);

                // process 128KB at a time
                var cipherBytes = new byte[0x20000];

                // loop until the end of the input file is reached
                int bytesRead = 0;
                while ((bytesRead = cipherStream.read(cipherBytes, 0, cipherBytes.length)) > 0) {
                    plainBytes = ubiqDecrypt.update(cipherBytes, 0, bytesRead);
                    plainStream.write(plainBytes);
                }

                // finish the decryption
                plainBytes = ubiqDecrypt.end();
                plainStream.write(plainBytes);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Ubiq Format Preserving Encryption

This library incorporates Ubiq Format Preserving Encryption (eFPE).

## Requirements

-   Please follow the same requirements as described above for the non-eFPE functionality.
-   eFPE requires an additional library called [ubiq-fpe-java] available for download in the Ubiq GitHub/GitLab repository.

## Usage

You will need to obtain account credentials in the same way as described above for conventional encryption/decryption. When
you do this in your [Ubiq Dashboard][dashboard] [credentials][credentials], you'll need to enable the eFPE option.
The credentials can be set using environment variables, loaded from an explicitly
specified file, or read from the default location (~/.ubiq/credentials).


### Referencing the Ubiq Security library
Make sure your source files import these public types from the ```ubiqsecurity``` library:

```java
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqFactory;
```

### Reading and setting credentials

The eFPE functions work with the credentials file and/or environmental variables in the same way as described
earlier in this document. You'll only need to make sure that the API keys you pull from the Ubiq dashboard are enabled for
eFPE capability.


### Encrypt a social security text field - simple interface
Pass credentials, the name of a Field Format Specification, FFS, and data into the encryption function.
The encrypted data will be returned.

```java
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqFactory;

String FfsName = "SSN";
String plainText = "123-45-6789";

UbiqCredentials ubiqCredentials = UbiqFactory.readCredentialsFromFile("path/to/file", "default");

String cipher = UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt.encryptFPE(ubiqCredentials, FfsName, plainText, null);
System.out.println("ENCRYPTED cipher= " + cipher + "\n");

```

### Decrypt a social security text field - simple interface
Pass credentials, the name of a Field Format Specification, FFS, and data into the decryption function.
The plain text data will be returned.

```java
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqFactory;

String FfsName = "SSN";
String cipherText = "7\"c-`P-fGj?";

UbiqCredentials ubiqCredentials = UbiqFactory.readCredentialsFromFile("path/to/file", "default");

String plainText = UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt.decryptFPE(ubiqCredentials, FfsName, cipherText, null);
System.out.println("DECRYPTED plain text= " + plainText + "\n");

```
### Encrypt a social security text field - bulk interface
Create an Encryption / Decryption object with the credentials and then allow repeatedly call encrypt
data using a Field Format Specification, FFS, and the data.  The encrypted data will be returned after each call


Note that you would only need to create the "ubiqEncryptDecrypt" object once for any number of encryptFPE and decryptFPE
calls, for example when you are bulk processing many such encrypt / decrypt operations in a session.



```java
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqFactory;

String FfsName = "SSN";
String plainText = "123-45-6789";

UbiqCredentials ubiqCredentials = UbiqFactory.readCredentialsFromFile("path/to/file", "default");
// Create single object but use many times
try (UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt ubiqEncryptDecrypt = new UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt(ubiqCredentials)) {
  // Can call encryptFPE / decryptFPE many times without creating new UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt object.
  String cipherText = ubiqEncryptDecrypt.encryptFPE(FfsName, plainText, null);
}
```

### Decrypt a social security text field - bulk interface
Create an Encryption / Decryption object with the credentials and then repeatedly decrypt
data using a Field Format Specification, FFS, and the data.  The decrypted data will be returned after each call.


Note that you would only need to create the "ubiqEncryptDecrypt" object once for any number of encryptFPE and decryptFPE
calls, for example when you are bulk processing many such encrypt / decrypt operations in a session.



```java
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqCredentials;
import ubiqsecurity.UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt;
import com.ubiqsecurity.UbiqFactory;

String FfsName = "SSN";
String cipherText = "7\"c-`P-fGj?";

UbiqCredentials ubiqCredentials = UbiqFactory.readCredentialsFromFile("path/to/file", "default");
// Create single object but use many times
try (UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt ubiqEncryptDecrypt = new UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt(ubiqCredentials)) {
  // Can call encryptFPE / decryptFPE many times without creating new UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt object.
  String plainText = ubiqEncryptDecrypt.encryptFPE(FfsName, cipherText, null);
}
```
## Custom Metadata for Usage Reporting
There are cases where a developer would like to attach metadata to usage information reported by the application.  Both the structured and unstructured interfaces allow user_defined metadata to be sent with the usage information reported by the libraries.

The <b>addReportingUserDefinedMetadata</b> function accepts a string in JSON format that will be stored in the database with the usage records.  The string must be less than 1024 characters and be a valid JSON format.  The string must include both the <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> symbols.  The supplied value will be used until the object goes out of scope.  Due to asynchronous processing, changing the value may be immediately reflected in subsequent usage.  If immediate changes to the values are required, it would be safer to create a new encrypt / decrypt object and call the <b>addReportingUserDefinedMetadata</b> function with the new values.

Examples are shown below.
```
...
try (UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt ubiqEncryptDecrypt = new UbiqFPEEncryptDecrypt(ubiqCredentials)) {
   ubiqEncryptDecrypt.addReportingUserDefinedMetadata("{\"some_meaningful_flag\" : true }")
   ....
   // FPE Encrypt and Decrypt operations
}
```

```
...
try (UbiqEncrypt ubiqEncrypt = new UbiqEncrypt(ubiqCredentials, 1)) {
   ubiqEncrypt.addReportingUserDefinedMetadata("{\"some_key\" : \"some_value\" }")
   ....
   // Unstructured Encrypt operations
}

```


Additional information on how to use these FFS models in your own applications is available by contacting
Ubiq. You may also view some use-cases implemented in the unit test [UbiqFPEEncryptTest.java] and the sample application [UbiqSampleFPE.java] source code
